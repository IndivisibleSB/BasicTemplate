This is a community meeting to discuss the plans to stop the Delta Tunnels. There is a $15 billion plan to create massive 40 ft diameter twin tunnels under the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to take water as far as Tracy. This tunnel would divert a large percent of the water to farm water-intensive crops. Concerns with the tunnels include the destruction of the Delta environment for hundreds of wildlife species and plants, impact on the Delta fisheries and farmers as well as the intrusion of saltwater and pollutants into the Bay. You can read more about it here. Hosted by Restore the Delta.
