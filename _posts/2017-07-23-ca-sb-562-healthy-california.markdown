From the event page: “Come educate yourself about all things healthcare (defunding of Medicaid, repeal of ACA, voucherizing Medicare), details and the current status of SB 562, ask questions from representatives, and learn from others.” This is a follow up event for the previous one on 6/6 with Michael Lighty and you can view it here. Presenters include Peggy Elwell and Katherine Block, both from Santa Clara County Single Payer Health Care Coalition and Low-Income Self-Help Center, and Greg Miller from Healthy California Campaign and California Alliance for Retired Americans.
