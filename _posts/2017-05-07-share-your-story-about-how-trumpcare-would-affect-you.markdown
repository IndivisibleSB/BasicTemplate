Senator Kamala Harris has put out a call for stories about how TrumpCare would affect you and what the ACA has done for you. From Senator Harris: “we need to share the stories of those who will be hurt the most if they lose their health insurance or protections for pre-existing conditions” It is important to share these stories so Senator Harris can use them make an argument against TrumpCare and show that real people will be affected by this bill. You can submit your story [here](http://go.kamalaharris.org/page/s/health-care-story?source=em170504-aca-story-full).
