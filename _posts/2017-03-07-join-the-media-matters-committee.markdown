The Indivisible South Bay Media Matters Committee will defend the integrity of the First Amendment, and promote a reliable, robust, and free media, which is the bedrock of a functional democracy.

Currently, our specific goals include:
Identifying Fake News and Combatting Trump's Undemocratic Characterization of Real News as Fake News
Monitoring whistleblower prosecutions against government workers who speak with the media
Monitoring censorship of Administrative and Judicial speech (i.e., gag orders to Administrative agencies, hiding how tax dollars are being spent)
Promoting media literacy
Combatting the normalization of white supremacy through news outlets endorsed by the Administration (such as Breitbart)
