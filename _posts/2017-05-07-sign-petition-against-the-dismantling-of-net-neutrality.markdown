[The FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has revealed initial plans to abolish net neutrality](https://www.recode.net/2017/5/4/15543802/reading-between-lines-fcc-chairman-ajit-pai-plan-net-neutrality). Net neutrality, if you don’t know, is “the principle that Internet service providers should enable access to all content and applications regardless of the source, and without favoring or blocking particular products or websites.” It is crucial to maintaining the current freedoms and accessibility that we experience on the internet today. This petition will be sent to Chairman Pai, Trump and Congress. Read more about it and sign [here](http://act.freepress.net/sign/internet_NN_trump).
