The Senate and House Intelligence Committees have not been able to make actionable progress to investigate Trump and his ties to Russia. The House Intelligence Committee investigation has fallen into shambles and the more recent Senate Intelligence Committee investigation does not have anyone assigned on a full-time basis, has not issued a single subpoena, and has not conducted interviews to produce information. Ask your senator to demand that there be a special prosecutor assigned to investigate. Note that Senator Feinstein is on the Senate Intelligence Committee.
