California currently has a bill SB 562 which would allow for single payer for all California State residents. This event is a great opportunity to learn about how the bill works exactly and how it would affect your current plan. Michael Lighty, the Director of Public Policy for National Nurses United, will present on the topic. This event is cosponsored by the Congregational Church of Sunnyvale, Indivisible South Bay, Our Revolution NorCal, Democratic Socialists of America (DSA)/Silicon Valley, and Santa Clara County Single Payer Healthcare Coalition.
