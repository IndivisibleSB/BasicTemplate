Religious groups such as Muslims, Christians and Dalits are being targeted in India. We have seen a rise in violent activities since 2014 when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power. Gangs with connections to BJP are responsible for the vast majority of these attacks. Horrible things are being perpetrated upon people with purpose of targeting and demeaning individuals because of their religion. Sign [this petition](https://www.change.org/p/rita-izs%C3%A1k-ndiaye-investigate-the-growing-human-rights-emergency-in-india-particularly-the-attacks-on-religious-minorities-and-dalits?recruiter=12254629&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=facebook&utm_campaign=share_petition&utm_term=share_petition&utm_content=nafta_share_post_title_en_3%3AFB_share_copy_2) to demand Rita Izs√°k-Ndiaye, the UN Special Rapporteur on Minority Issues, to investigate.
