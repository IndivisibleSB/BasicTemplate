Come and watch the sequel to An Inconvenient Truth, An Inconvenient Sequel, with ISB on a Sunday afternoon! If you’re interested, take [this survey](https://goo.gl/forms/hFi4HAzYuRJXxtvs2) to let us know which show time is better for you and if you’re interested in a post-film discussion. We plan to meet 20 minutes before the film starts, with ticket in hand, to go find seating together. Watch the trailer for the film [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZLZeeE_4nI) and sign up with the link below if you’d like to receive updates on the event.
