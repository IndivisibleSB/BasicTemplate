[HR 1899](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1899) and [S 823](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/823) are bipartisan mirror bills in the House and Senate introduced on April 4th that would protect people from indiscriminate and suspicionless searches of phones, laptops and tablets when crossing the border. Currently a loophole exists that allows border agents to do just that, entirely sidestepping our right to privacy. This bill would require a warrant to search a personâ€™s digital belongings as it would occur anywhere else in the United States not at a border. Tell Senators Feinstein and Harris and your congressperson how crucial and important this bill is and that we need their public support and their vote.
