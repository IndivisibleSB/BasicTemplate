Trump has recently signed an order that would allow for tax exempt organizations, including churches, to endorse political candidates. This directly conflicts with the [Johnson Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_Amendment), enacted in 1954. Congress will have to repeal the Johnson Amendment in order to allow Trump’s executive order to come into effect but the implications of the order are disastrous. The order essentially instructs the IRS to take a more lenient stance on the Johnson Amendment, allowing for these organizations to not lose their tax-exempt status when endorsing politicians. Call California’s Attorney General Xavier Becerra to tell him you oppose this order. Ask Becerra to publicly commit to challenging this unconstitutional executive order. Also call your MOCs to tell them that you are against this order and you expect them to publicly oppose the order.
