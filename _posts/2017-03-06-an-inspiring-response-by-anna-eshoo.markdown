Yesterday, March 5th, Anna Eshoo hosted a "Call to Action" event in Palo Alto.  Attended by more than 400 experienced and new activists, this was an opportunity to connect those looking for outlets for newly found passion with those of us who are already engaged in the fight to affirm our values and to protect our people and institutions from the onslaught of darkness.

Most specific to the Indivisible movement, this event brought together at least separate, disconnected, Indivisible groups from Menlo Park, Portola Valley, Cupertino, Palo alto, Los Altos, Sunnyvale, and Campbell.  New we are connected -- our movement is expanding!

The event also included a panel discussion among leaders of the "resistance" and experienced community organizers.  It was a perfect example of an effective and empowering response to the continuing Trump-ublican outrages.
