From the event page: “March For Science Silicon Valley celebrates the crucial roles science plays in driving our economic growth, preserving our environment, and protecting the health of our citizens.” The march will start at 11am at San Jose City Hall and then move to a rally at noon at the Plaza de Cesar Chavez where the event will combine with the Silicon Valley Comic Con event.
