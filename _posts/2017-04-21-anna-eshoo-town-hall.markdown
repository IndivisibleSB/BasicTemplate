Town halls are ideal scenario to interact with your MOCs and really what Indivisible is all about. Anna Eshoo is the Congresswoman for CA 18 so if you’re in this district it is important to go and represent your concerns and requests. The event will also be livestreamed to [Anna Eshoo’s Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/RepAnnaEshoo/).
