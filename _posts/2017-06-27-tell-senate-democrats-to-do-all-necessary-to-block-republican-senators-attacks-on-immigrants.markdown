GOP Senators are now ramping up bills that will allow racial profiling and ease deportations with the result of traumatizing and separating families. Democratic Senators were able to push GOP Senators in order to remove funding for the border wall and more deportation efforts months ago so we are hoping it can happen again when these same demands have appeared in Trumpâ€™s 2018 budget. These new bills include more funding for deportations, lower standards for border patrol hires, local law enforcers now also being responsible to aid deportations, fining of cities and counties that do not aid the deportation effort, and much more.
