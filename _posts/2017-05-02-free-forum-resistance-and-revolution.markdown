This event is a grassroots review of Trumpâ€™s first 100 days in office and will feature local grassroots leaders and of course your participation. This discussion is meant to provide the feedback we are not hearing in the news (that of the grassroots organizations) and will revolve around the idea of moving from resistance to revolution. Speakers will include Charlotte Casey from CODE PINK San Jose,  Kim Hunter from Silicon Valley Courageous Resistance and Paul George, a Director of the Peninsula Peace and Justice Center.
