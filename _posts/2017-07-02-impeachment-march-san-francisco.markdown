Donald Trump has shown little regard for our laws especially when they are in regards to his business holdings and dealings. He has undermined the legitimacy of every institution our democracy relies on not to mention the obstructions of justice. This march is to show congress that we demand they take these offenses seriously and launch a formal investigation immediately.
