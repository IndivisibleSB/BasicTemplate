Senator Kamala Harris has put out a petition for you to sign to tell Trump that it would be unacceptable and irresponsible for us to back out of the Paris Climate Agreement. Not only would our European allies strongly disapprove but as a planet we simply can’t put off responding to climate change any longer. Abandoning this agreement would not only look bad but it is a step in the wrong direction. Sign Senator Harris’ petition [here](http://go.kamalaharris.org/page/s/paris-accord?source=em170418-full).
