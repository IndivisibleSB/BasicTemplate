This vigil will act as a counter to an anti-Muslim protest that is to occur a block away from our unity event. ACT for America is planning anti-Muslim rallies during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in cities across the US. This vigil is intended to be peaceful and not meant to engage with the anti-Muslim rally. To show support you can also [sign this statement against hate](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScgCAwVdA4QiQsVXslRncytdCNEc87RVnhUTZMlkXrWaXogIg/viewform?c=0&w=1). Cohosted by ISB.
