During the Obama era, there were restrictions of who the United States would sell weapons to but Rex Tillerson has lifted all human rights preconditions on a major sale of fighter jets and other lethal weapons to Bahrain. Congress has the ability to block the sale of arms at any time up until the point of delivery. Ask Congress to never allow the United States to sell weapons to human rights abusers.
