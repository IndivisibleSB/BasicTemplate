The EPA Administrator has opened up a comment line on the topic of the EPA “seeking input on regulations that may be appropriate for repeal, replacement, or modification.” This is a follow up to an executive order that Trump signed called Enforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda. This order is meant to “to alleviate unnecessary regulatory burdens”. This is a great opportunity to share your thoughts and feelings on the purpose of the EPA and its responsibilities to the American people. Comment line is open until May 15th so you must comment today!
