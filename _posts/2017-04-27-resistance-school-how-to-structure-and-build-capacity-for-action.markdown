Some progressive students from Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government have decided to create a “Resistance School” which covers everything from how to express and form our own political ideas, how to mobilize groups, and how to sustain the movement. This will be their third session. You can watch this session [on their website](https://www.resistanceschool.com/session-four-1/) or [on Facebook Live](https://www.facebook.com/ResistSchool/).
