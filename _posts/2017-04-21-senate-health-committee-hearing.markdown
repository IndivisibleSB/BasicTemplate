On April 26th, the Senate Health Committee will have a hearing in Sacramento and will vote on [SB 562](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB562) or The Healthy California Act. The act creates a single health care plan so that all Californians can have access to healthcare. The plan would lower co-pays and deductibles as well as take the control from the insurance companies and give it back to Californians. Health Care for All is providing buses to Sacramento from around the state and the closest stop is in San Jose at 1871 The Alameda, #300 which will leave at 7:40am and if you want a ride you must reserve a seat [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdsjQaZxlLEklYSQRoxeJ0w2kU3-EJNCezGHAglcRodYpW49g/viewform). When you arrive there will be a HealthyCA presentation by Michael Lightly at 10:30am.
