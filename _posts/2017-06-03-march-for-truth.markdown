March for Truth is a national movement taking place on June 3rd to show our commitment to getting the truth in relations to Trump, his administration, their ties to Russia and many other ethically questionable acts. The march is also specifically calling for the independent investigation of Trump’s ties to Russia, a release of Trump’s tax returns and for information to be made public. You can read more about the mission here. Indivisible East San Jose will be posting this March.
