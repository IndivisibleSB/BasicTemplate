As you probably heard, there was a vote in the House today where TrumpCare was narrowly passed. Now is the time to call your Senators (you can call them multiple times about the same issue!) to let them know that passing TrumpCare would be unacceptable. Senator Harris has explicitly asked you to call her with your concerns and Senator Feinstein has made [some expressions of disagreement with AHCA](https://twitter.com/senfeinstein/status/842487999539625985) but both these Senators need more calls and a stronger show of opposition against the AHCA and ACA repeal. Indivisible has put together [an updated script](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/resource/demand-member-congress-oppose-trumpcare/) for calling MOCs as well that you should take a look at.
Kamala Harris: (202) 224-3553
Dianne Feinstein: (202) 224-384
