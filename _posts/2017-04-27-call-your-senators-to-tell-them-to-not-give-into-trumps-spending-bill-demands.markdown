Midnight on April 28th is when congress has to agree on a Fiscal Year spending bill. Trump has already made many threats of how he will hold up the spending bill from passing if Congress does not bend to his will and do things such as make cuts to the EPA, Planned Parenthood, or fund deportation and the border wall. Tell your MOCs that you don’t want them to give in and that we need to pass an acceptable budget. Ask them to focus on passing a bipartisan budget without any major policy changes so we can avoid a government shutdown. Call Senators Harris and Feinstein.
