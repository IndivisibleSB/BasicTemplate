This event is a rally followed by a march. From the event page: “The Trump/Pence Regime daily escalates its fascist attacks on immigrants and Muslims, on healthcare and the poor, on Black and Brown people, on women and LGBTQ folks, on the media, on the environment, on the right to protest, on the truth.” Hosted by Refuse Fascism Bay Area.
