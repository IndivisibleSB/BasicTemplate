Again, the GOP is attempting to repeal the ACA and replace it with a disastrous plan. The amended version that was introduced is yet again unclear even to GOP members who are reportedly still being educated on the bill as it is being intended to be pushed through. The updates to the bill go against what Trump has promised his supporters. Tell your representatives that we need more clarity and this is not a bill that should just be pushed through with brute force. Demand a CBO score as we did last time to see what this plan would really do the American people.
