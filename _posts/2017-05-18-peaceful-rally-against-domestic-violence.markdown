In recent news in Silicon Valley, a case appeared about a tech CEOâ€™s abuse of his wife, also a prominent figure in the tech community. The wife was able to provide conclusive video tape evidence of the prolonged abusive relationship she experienced at the hands of her husband and yet the court has offered the husband a deal of just 30 days in jail. This is the same court where Brock Turner was given only a six month sentence after a highly publicized, horrific rape case. This is an excellent opportunity for Silicon Valley to show that it believes this treatment of domestic violence survivors is unacceptable. Papiha Nandy, Founder and CEO of Papiha Nandy Broadcasting Co., has organized this rally, to occur outside the Palo Alto Courthouse. The event page also includes some information for calls you can make about this case.
