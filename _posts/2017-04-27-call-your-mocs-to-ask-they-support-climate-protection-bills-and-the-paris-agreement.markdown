Trump has been threatening to back out from the Paris Agreement so we need to tell our representatives that he cannot do this and they need to publicly express this. Additionally, S 767 and HR 1812 are climate bills which are both aimed at protecting the EPA and going against detrimental executive orders Trump has signed. Let your representatives know this is something you care about.

Kamala Harris: (202) 224-3553
Dianne Feinstein: (202) 224-3841
