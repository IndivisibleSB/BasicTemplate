Last week we asked you to sign a petition against the abolishment on Net Neutrality. This week a comment line has opened to contact Ajit Pai, FCC Chairman that has announced plans to abolish net neutrality. Net neutrality, if you don’t know, is “the principle that Internet service providers should enable access to all content and applications regardless of the source, and without favoring or blocking particular products or websites.” It is crucial to maintaining the current freedoms and accessibility that we experience on the internet today. Leave a comment for Ajit Pai [here](https://www.battleforthenet.com/) and call your two senators and your congressperson to officially voice your disagreement with the abolishment of net neutrality.
