Hosted by Indivisible South Bay and Jessica Dickinson Goodman is an event to help teach us how to become civically engaged and the most accessible, affordable and impactful techniques for ensuring we are heard by our elected representatives. The event will feature post card writing sessions while hearing from local leaders such as a Sunnyvale City Council member, Marc Berman’s district director, the president of the National Women’s Political Caucus of Silicon Valley among others. Please RSVP and bring a postage stamp so you can send off your letters at the event.
