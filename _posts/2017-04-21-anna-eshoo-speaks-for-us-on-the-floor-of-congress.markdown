Our local Anna Eshoo spoke up in Congress this week (as she had promised to do last Sunday) to introduce a resolution to force disclosure of Trump’s tax records.  She was shut down by Steve Womack, Republican of Arkansas, who was presiding over the House at the time — but not before she got her compelling message across.  Thank her by going to http://eshoo.house.gov/contact/.

Links to a youtube video of her efforts are below.
