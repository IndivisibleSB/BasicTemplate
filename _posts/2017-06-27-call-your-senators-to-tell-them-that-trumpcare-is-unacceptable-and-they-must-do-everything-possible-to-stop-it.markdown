In particular, this time we will be calling the legislative assistants to ask them to put all of the Senator’s attention on stopping Trumpcare. Call them daily to make sure they know that this is a critical bill that could affect us for many years to come. Use resources provided by Indivisible to talk to your Senators [here](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/resource/senate-health-care-staffers/#CA).
