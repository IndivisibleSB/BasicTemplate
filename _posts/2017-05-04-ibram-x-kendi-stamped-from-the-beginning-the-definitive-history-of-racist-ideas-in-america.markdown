Ibram X. Kendi will talk about his recent book, Stamped From the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America which is “a comprehensive history of anti-Black racist ideas-their origins in fifteenth century Portugal, their arrival in England in the mid-sixteenth century, their blossoming in the United States, where they became founding principles in our nation's institutions and guarantors of its power.” This event is tickets with $12 tickets online [here](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/2898170) and $15 tickets at the door.
