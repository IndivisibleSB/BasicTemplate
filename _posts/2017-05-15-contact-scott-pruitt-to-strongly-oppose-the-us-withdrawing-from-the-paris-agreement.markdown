Trump has announced multiple times that he intends and would like to withdraw from the Paris agreement, a landmark agreement made during the Obama Era to ensure our future on this planet. Recently, [Trump has also held meetings on the matter](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/05/02/in-the-trump-white-house-the-momentum-has-turned-against-the-paris-climate-agreement/?utm_term=.273143e9fbbb). Contact Administrator of the EPA Scott Pruitt, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Energy Secretary Rick Perry to let them know you strongly oppose the United States going back on this agreement. It would affect our international relationships and it is a move in the wrong direction.
