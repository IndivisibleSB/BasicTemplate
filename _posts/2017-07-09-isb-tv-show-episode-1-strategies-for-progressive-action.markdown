One of our members had the idea to create an ISB video series that covers topics such as what ISB is about, how to get involved, what to do in a blue district and the progress our issue committees are making. Robert Edgar Directed and Produced the film and our co-directors Lisa Ferino and Eitan Fenson as well as Lynn Cunningham and Laurel Michel appear in this episode on "Strategies for Progressive Action".
