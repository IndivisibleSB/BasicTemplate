Over 90 cities nationally will be marching on June 11 to honor LGBTQ+ equality and justice. From the event: “Equality March San José is meant to encourage self expression and education on our political climate, while allowing our community to march in solidarity.” Equality March San José will begin at San Jose City Hall at 11:00 AM and lead to the Unity and Pride Rally at Plaza De Cesar Chavez Park beginning at 1:00 PM. Please consider [offering to volunteer](https://equalitymarchsj.domoreproject.org/action/#volunteer) at the March as they need more helping hands. Surprisingly there will be no San Francisco Equality March and if you’re curious you can read more about it [here](http://www.sfweekly.com/news/news-news/equality-march-is-on-but-not-in-s-f/).
