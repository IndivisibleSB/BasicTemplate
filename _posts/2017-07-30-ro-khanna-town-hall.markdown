As our Members of Congress are on recess, make sure to get out to these town halls. These events are crucial in hearing from the people that represent you on a national level as well as communicating to them what is important to you. Ro Khanna will discuss “recent developments and current legislative activities in Congress and take questions from constituents in attendance.” This event space has an occupancy of 300 people and is first come first serve.
