Private prisons have started to get attention for the way they are being used to imprison illegal immigrants. [Trump’s policies have majorly benefited these private prisons which were in no need of help to begin with](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/05/03/this-private-prison-company-is-getting-rich-off-donald-trump-s-immigration-crackdown). This country has struggled with massive incarceration [for decades](http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/issues/military-police-and-arms/police-and-human-rights/mass-incarceration-in-the-usa) but it continues to grow. From the petition: “Immigrants arrested by the Border Patrol serve an average sentence of 360 days in a private prison for behaviors that weren’t considered crimes ten years ago.” Read more about it and sign [here](http://petitions.moveon.org/sign/congress-deny-funding).
