[HR 1180](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1180), or the deceptively named “Working Families Flexibility Act”, would allow for employers to demand their employees to work overtime without adjusted pay. The bill allows for employers to given compensatory time to their employees rather than paying them for time and a half when they go over 40 work hours in a week. This allows employers to give overtime to those that are willing to forego pay rather than giving it to those that need to work the extra hours and need the extra pay. [Employees can save up 160 hours of comp time but the employer has entire control over when the employee is able to use that time](http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/labor/327391-comp-time-bill-is-back-and-still-hurts-workers). Tell your Representatives that you do not agree with this deceptive bill and that they should vote against it.
