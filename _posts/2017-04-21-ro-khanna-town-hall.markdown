Town halls are ideal scenario to interact with your MOCs and really what Indivisible is all about. Ro Khanna is the Congressman for CA 17. ISB has recently met with him along with other local groups and we found him to be very receptive. Go to show your support, give him your thoughts and concerns personally or just listen to his responses.
